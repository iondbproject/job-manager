@brief		A simple job manager for sensor node applications. Jobs are
		stored in IonDB.
@details	Retrieving data off of sensor networks via any sort of protocol,
		over a network or possibly a serial port, is made easier
		when "requests" or "jobs" can be processed on device.
		This code makes managing jobs much simpler. Once a number
		of jobs have been created, jobs can be processed using
		either direct C calls or JSON arrays, having the format:
		
			[<job-name>, <parameter list>]
